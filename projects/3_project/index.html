However, despite its potential and rapid technological progress, its adoption in real-world scenarios remains limited. This work aims to address the barriers preventing wider development and deployment by creating a <strong>taxonomy of pain points</strong> through an extensive literature review. We further propose a set of <strong>design guidelines</strong> specific to the unique characteristics of CVAI.</p> <p>Our research includes a two-stage evaluation process:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Factorial Survey:</strong> Experts assess the extent to which design solutions align with the proposed guidelines.</li> <li> <strong>Prototype-Based User Study:</strong> This study examines the user experience quality of various designs, demonstrating that higher compliance with the guidelines leads to a significantly improved user experience.</li> </ol> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/guideline/app_screenshot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/guideline/app_screenshot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/guideline/app_screenshot-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/guideline/app_screenshot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Real-time word recognition when pointing at text. </div> <p>In this project, I contributed by developing a Computer Vision AI prototype designed to validate the proposed guidelines. The core feature of the application is its ability to recognize text that the user’s index finger is pointing at and store the detected words on the user’s device. This prototype addresses <strong>all six identified pain points</strong> and satisfies <strong>four out of the eighteen proposed guidelines</strong>. The major technologies used include Android Studio, MLKit, and MediaPipe.</p> <hr> <h2 id="presentation-slides">Presentation Slides</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTPMfGOcwwrf5QuqyR4fzZfsAIjNg_tCp4_efGy0KqMM_3FEoi--LDF7YDExBtK75h8R11hdyzeasnb/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="749" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div> </div> </div> <hr> </body></html>
