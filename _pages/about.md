Hi! Iâ€™m Jaeyeon Park.  
I'm a first-year MS student in the [Human-Centered Computing Systems Lab]() at Seoul National University, under the guidance of Professor [Youngki Lee](https://youngkilee.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html).  
I graduated with high honors in Computer Science from Yonsei University in 2024 and have been working as a research intern at the Human-Centered Computing Systems Lab since the summer of 2022.

My research interests include Neural 3D Synthesis (3D Gaussian Splatting, NeRF) and optimizing graphics systems for mobile devices.  
I am currently working on developing hyper-realistic 3D streaming and rendering systems for mobile devices with [Kyungjin](https://kyungjin-lee.github.io/), Hyunwoo, and Prof. Youngki.





<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
